# Stock Overflow 

A simple inventory management system capable of tracking product serial number, name, quantity, expiration date, and price.

The inventory system contains 6 key features; Add, View, Update Stock, Update Price, Delete Item, and Search Item.

Stock Overflow also includes a login system, capable of creating accounts and securing passwords via encryption.

All of the data is stored through a text file.

This is a school project for the course Object Oriented Programming 1.
I made this program with a team member. Specifically, I made the inventory system and they made the login system.

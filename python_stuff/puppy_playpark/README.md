# Puppy Playpark

A small simulation game where you can play with dogs, as well as feed them and watch them bark.
It's a very simple CLI based project that taught me how to handle instances of a class as well as class attributes.

This is one of the mini projects I did when I was studying Object Oriented Programming 1.
